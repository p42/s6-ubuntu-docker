## Introduction
A docker image based on Ubuntu Linux with the s6 process supervisor

### What is Ubuntu Linux?

Ubuntu is a free and open source operating system and Linux distribution based on Debian. Ubuntu has a large community and is widely used from desktops to servers.

### What is the s6-overlay?
The [s6-overlay project](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay) is a series of init scripts and utilities to ease creating Docker images using s6 as a process supervisor.  The s6-overlay makes it easy to take advantages of s6 while still operate like other Docker images.  The s6 init system provides many helpful tools to initialize and manage processes as the Docker container starts.
